## Overview
The **Students Facial Attention Detection** project is aimed at creating an automated system that analyzes students' facial expressions and attention levels. It can be used in educational settings to monitor student engagement, identify when a student may be distracted, and help improve teaching methods based on real-time feedback.

The project leverages popular facial detection models like **dlib** and **OpenCV** for detecting facial landmarks and analyzing the students' focus during learning sessions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- dlib
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Facial landmark detection
- Machine Learning (Optional)

## Files

- **FaceDetectionFinal.ipynb**: The final notebook with the complete face detection and attention analysis model.
- **FaceDetectionMain.ipynb**: The primary notebook for facial landmark detection and attention calculation.
- **FaceDetectionTest.ipynb**: A testing notebook used for debugging and testing the face detection accuracy on different images or video streams.
- **shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat**: The pre-trained model file used for detecting facial landmarks, which is required for face and attention tracking.
